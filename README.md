It's a simple To-do app. As a beginner, creating these features like DOM manipulations, animations and dark theme feature was challenging for me. So let's see how I created this and what I've learned from it.

##Prerequisite Knowledge
Basics of HTML, CSS and JS (specially DOM Manipulations)

##What I've Learned
DOM Manipulation
Classlist
ChildNodes
Forms
Changing Themes

##Let's Start
We will create this project step by step.

1. Brainstorming
First you have to plan the features of your to-do app. You can use any software to plan your project or just a pen and paper. I generally prefer to plan everything in Notion.

2. Sketching
Make a simple sketch of To-do app which contains all your decided features.

3. Prototype
Make a prototype of your app using previous sketch. You can also follow these steps to design your app.

Make a color palette of 3 colors.
Choose the typeface.
Collect SVG icons
Start designing
Design the Dark theme
