It's a simple To-do app. As a beginner, creating these features like DOM manipulations, animations and dark theme feature was challenging for me. So let's see how I created this and what I've learned from it.

##Prerequisite Knowledge
Basics of HTML, CSS and JS (specially DOM Manipulations)

##What I've Learned
DOM Manipulation
Classlist
ChildNodes
Forms
Changing Themes

##Let's Start
We will create this project step by step.

1. Brainstorming
First you have to plan the features of your to-do app. You can use any software to plan your project or just a pen and paper. I generally prefer to plan everything in Notion.

2. Sketching
Make a simple sketch of To-do app which contains all your decided features.

3. Prototype
Make a prototype of your app using previous sketch. You can also follow these steps to design your app.

Make a color palette of 3 colors.
Choose the typeface.
Collect SVG icons
Start designing
Design the Dark theme


4. Setup Project Environment
In this step, setup the directories and create files for your project.

5. Create HTML structure
Open your index.html file and create the html structure. Don't forget to link your CSS and Js file with index.html.

6. Add CSS Styling
Open your style.css file to style the to-do app. Follow these steps to style your to-do.

Set root variables
Define container layouts
Set hover effects
Style input placeholder using pseudo classes.
Add Media queries

When user enter a new task in input and submit the form the task input value will go to a function , which creates a task element with checkbox using task input value. then add another function, which remove the task item when checkbox get checked.

Open your script.js file and style the to-do app. Follow these steps to add JS Functionality.
It's done!!
